- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jhall773
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in engineering software that assists, inspires, and/or brings hope to others. Whether its helping design smart systems to manage and communicate data or games with positive storylines and themes, I aspire to make an impact with code (by engineering it with structure) rather than just "write" it.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Software Engineering at St. Mary's University.
